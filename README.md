### 1. Overall applicationâ€™s concept:

#### EventStay is an app that allows the user to find a place to stay after searching for an event. #### The user can buy available tickets to the event, as well as see the lowest prices listed for the #### places to stay near the event.

### 2. The motivation for its development:

#### We want to simplify the process of searching for an event and finding places to stay near the #### event in one location, vs. having to search multiple sources. We want to make the app user 
#### friendly(easy to navigate).

### 3. The technologies that we used:

#### A. Nanette - Front-End HTML using Materialize
#### B. Teresa - Data persistence for Search input using local-storage(saves the previous Search user
####    input), implemented class feedback into the app(updated missing elements in the app)
#### C. Michael - Events: Using AJAX to pull data from SeatGeek API
#### D. David - Hotels: Using AJAX to pull data from hotwire API

### 4. Directions for future development:

#### Adding the transportation option(Uber, train/airline information), Spotify
